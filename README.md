# Resource Consuption Across Programming Languages (RCAP)

This project started due to our university class, and serves as another source of information for this topic. This is an idependant research hence some of the results are limited to what the time we had and the systems we have.

## Objective

Explore if the methods in which different languages compile and determine if there are substantial differences that may help a programmer determine if they want to use one language or another.

DISCLAIMER: Since we are poor college students with limited time we only explore 3 languages, C#, C++ and Python.

## How to run the code?

Since each folder has a different programming languages not all languages can be run without installing different things, so pleae look at each folder to be able to run the code.

## Methods

For each langauge we measure resource consuption using different internal libraries for that program. We maintain 3 constant variables CPU usage, Memory Consumption,  Energy Consumption and execution time.


If interested in knowing each one, please head to the specific folder, they should or will have more details on which specific libraries were used and wether this was installed using a command / terminal.

## Conclusion

Although we read the following articles that are referenced in "document.docx" we found similar results. However unlike some we didn't have the budget or the tools available to measure energy consuption externally.
